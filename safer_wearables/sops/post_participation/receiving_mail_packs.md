Follow these steps when receiving a mail pack in the post returned from a participant:

## Identify the participant

Identify the participant from:
- The 'return address' shown on the mail label
- The participant ID on the questionnaire

## Clean devices

Clean the devices and accessories using wipes.

## Fill out the device return receipt

Open the 'Device return receipt' qualtrics questionnaire, and fill out the details, noting the following:
- If possible, it's helpful to enter the questionnaire responses into the separate qualtrics questionnaire when prompted.
- This will require downloading the data from devices and storing it, which can take some time. See the 'Receiving Devices' SOP for details of how to do this.
