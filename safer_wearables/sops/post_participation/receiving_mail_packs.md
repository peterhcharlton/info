Follow these steps when receiving a mail pack in the post returned from a participant:

## Open the package

Open the bag and the box inside. Throw away any spare chest dots, and any non-confidential paper (e.g. envelopes without IDs, instruction leaflet).

If there are any additional items in the box then please make sure they have a participant ID written on them, and store them for review.

## Fill out the device return receipt

Open the 'Device return receipt' qualtrics questionnaire, and fill out the details, noting the following:
- If possible, it's helpful to enter the questionnaire responses into the separate qualtrics questionnaire when prompted.

## Where to put the package

Once the 'Device return receipt has been filled out':
- If the questionnaire responses have been recorded then place the questionnaire in the 'SAFER Wearables' box in the filing room. If not then keep the questionnaire in the box.
- Place the package in the 'SAFER Wearables Devices (Cleaned but not disconnected)' box in the filing room.
- Put the bag in the confidential waste.

## Notes on downloading data
these notes are to be added to a different SOP:
- There is the option to download the data from devices and store it, which can take some time. If doing this then see the [Receiving Devices SOP](./device_post_participation) for details of how to do this.
