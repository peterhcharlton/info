## Preparation

Ensure the devices have been setup as detailed in the [Device Setup SOP](./device_setup). Currently, we are using the following three devices:
- Bittium Faros 180
- PulseOn OHR Tracker
- PulseOn Arrythmia Monitor

## Printing

Ensure that the following are printed:
- 2 x return labels
- Instruction leaflet
- Questionnaire (including the participant ID)

## Prepare mail pack

Prepare two bags each consisting of:
- Bag: currently using polyethene bags measuring 350x405 mm
- Return address label: a label on each bag stating "If undelivered please return to: SAFER Wearables Study; Strangeways Research Laboratory; 2 Worts Causeway; Cambridge; CB1 8RN".


Prepare a device box consisting of:
- A cardboard box (currently using brown boxes measuring 240x240x40mm)
- Foam inserts (currently using three pieces of foam: one at the bottom and top measuring 6 mm thick, and a middle layer measuring 25mm thick).
- Three wearable devices (already set up)
- Charger for the PulseOn Arrythmia Monitor
- Check that there is an electrode cable already in the Bittium Faros device
Selotape the device box shut.

Prepare a return envelope consisting of:
- Questionnaire
- Return bag (with return label)
- A5 Envelope stating "To open when ready to return devices. Contains: (i) Questionnaire; (ii) Return bag (for the box to be put in)."
Put the questionnaire and return bag in the envelope, and selotape it shut. Then selotape the return envelope to the device box.


Prepare a mail pack by taking the remaining bag and putting in it:
- Device box
- Instruction leaflet
- Chest dots envelope
