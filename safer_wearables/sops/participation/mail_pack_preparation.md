## Device setup

Ensure the devices have been setup as detailed in the [device setup SOP](./device_preparation). Currently, we are using the following three devices:
- Bittium Faros 180
- PulseOn OHR Tracker
- PulseOn Arrythmia Monitor

## Prepare mail pack

Prepare a mail pack consisting of:
- A cardboard box (currently using brown boxes measuring 240x240x40mm)
- Foam inserts (currently using three pieces of foam: one at the bottom and top measuring 6 mm thick, and a middle layer measuring 25mm thick).
- Bags: one for outward, and one for return (currently using polyethene measuring 350x405 mm). Both with return address labels.
- Instruction leaflet
- Questionnaire
- Three wearable devices (already set up)
- Charger for the PulseOn Arrythmia Monitor
- Check that there is an electrode cable already in the Bittium Faros device
- Electrodes in an envelope (8 electrodes)
