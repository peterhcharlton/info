## Preparation

Ensure the devices have been setup as detailed in the [Device Setup SOP](./device_setup). Currently, we are using the following three devices:
- Bittium Faros 180
- PulseOn OHR Tracker
- PulseOn Arrythmia Monitor

## Printing

Ensure that the following are printed:
- 2 x return labels
- Instruction leaflet
- Questionnaire (without participant ID): _the last page needs to be in colour_

## Prepare mail pack

Prepare two bags each consisting of:
- Bag: currently using polyethene bags measuring 350x405 mm
- Return address label: a label on each bag stating "If undelivered please return to: SAFER Wearables Study; Strangeways Research Laboratory; 2 Worts Causeway; Cambridge; CB1 8RN". Put the label on the left hand side of the back of the bag.

Prepare a device box consisting of:
- A cardboard box (currently using brown boxes measuring 240x240x40mm)
- Foam inserts: _currently using two pieces of foam: one at the bottom measuring 6 mm thick, and a middle layer measuring 25mm thick. Each should be 235x235mm._
- Three wearable devices (already set up)
- Charger for the PulseOn Arrythmia Monitor
- Check that there is an electrode cable already in the Bittium Faros device

Prepare a return envelope consisting of:
- Questionnaire (with participant ID hand-written on it)
- Return bag (with return label)
- A5 Envelope stating "To open when ready to return devices. Contains: (i) Questionnaire; (ii) Return bag (for the box to be put in); (iii) Sticker to shut box with."

Prepare a 'Chest dots' envelope by:
- Inserting six electrodes into an envelope
- Writing 'Chest dots' on the outside
- Selotaping it shut

Fill out the 'Device pack preparation' qualtrics CRF.

Put the questionnaire and return bag in the envelope, and selotape it shut. Then selotape the return envelope to the device box.

Prepare a mail pack by taking the remaining bag and putting in it:
- Device box
- Instruction leaflet
- Chest dots envelope
