## Informed Consent Telephone Discussion 

### Discussion about taking part

_This is taken from Section 11.2 (Study Procedures > Informed Consent) of the Protocol._

Potential participants who are interested in participating will call the study team (as indicated in the invitation letter). During the call, a study team member will:
- Check that the potential participant is interested in taking part.
- Ask for the potential participant?s name and contact number (which will be destroyed if the participant does not want to take part).
- Determine whether the potential participant is eligible for the study.
- Check whether the potential participant is currently taking part in any other research studies (and if so, check for any potential safety concerns).
- Outline the study with reference to the PIS, and answer any questions.
- State that participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time, with no obligation to give a reason for withdrawal.
- Ask whether the potential participant has decided whether they would like to take part:
   - **If they do not want to take part:** they will be asked whether they would indicate their reasons for declining the invitation (although there will be no obligation to do so).
   - **If they are undecided:** they will be asked if the study team could call them to discuss the study after they have had at least a further 24 hours (or longer if they wish) to think about the invitation.
   - **If they would like to take part:** they will be asked if they have had long enough to decide, and if so, they will be asked to provide consent by returning the consent form using the prepaid envelope.

_Record in the database:_ date and time of discussion, the participant's decision, and (if not taking part) any reason(s) given.

   - _Wrist ECG:_ Withings Move ECG (or alternative wrist ECG device), with phone
