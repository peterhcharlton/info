## Providing resources to GP Practices

The following steps are taken with each GP Practice:
- Docmail:
  - Set up a docmail account for the GP Practice.
  - Include the invitation pack, printed on 'Black and White Duplex (Double sided), consisting of:
    - invitation letter (`v1.0_initial_docmail`)
    - participant information sheet (`v.1.2`)
    - consent form (`v1.3_docmail`)
    - reply slip (`v.1.0_docmail`)
    - prepaid envelope (`v.0.1` - although this needs to be updated with the freepost number)
  - Share the login details with the GP Practice.
  - An excel spreadsheet of mail data (based on the [template](https://www.cfhdocmail.com/live/ExampleDownload.aspx?Filename=LetterTemplate.doc) described [here](https://www.cfhdocmail.com/live/help.aspx)), including the following fields:
    - Full name: Potential participant's name
    - Address 1,2,3,4,5: Potential participant's address (NB: don't use 'Address 6')
    - Custom 1: Mailing date
    - Custom 2: GP Practice name
    - Custom 3: GP Practice address (on one line, comma separated)
    - Custom 4: GP name
    - Custom 5: Invite ID (5 digit number)

## Inviting potential participants

- (if requested at SIV) Arrange a convenient time for a remote meeting to send invitation letters.
  - Check that all address fields have been mapped correctly (in particular 'Custom 4' seems to default to 'ignore').

## Follow-up

- (if necessary) Ask for confirmation that invitation letters have been sent.
