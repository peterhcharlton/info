Each participating GP Practice is provided with a list of up to 42 potential participants at their practice. The potential participants are identified as follows:
- All participants diagnosed with AF (n = nAF) during SAFER screening are included in the list. The remaining places on the list (n = 42-nAF) are allocated to a random selection of participants who received any diagnosis other than 'screening failure' in SAFER.
- A list of participants is created by the SAFER Team
