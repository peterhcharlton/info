Each participating GP Practice is provided with a list of up to 42 potential participants at their practice. The potential participants are identified as follows:
- All SAFER participants diagnosed with AF (n = nAF) during SAFER screening are included in the list. The remaining places on the list (n = 42-nAF) are allocated to a random selection of SAFER participants who received any diagnosis other than 'screening failure'.
- A list of these potential participants is created through a SAFER database export.
- This list is converted into a list suitable for sharing with GP Practices (including removing any superfluous fields such as SAFER study ID).
