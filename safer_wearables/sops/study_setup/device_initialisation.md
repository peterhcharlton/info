   - don't copy apps and data;  
   - don't sign in to Google;  
   - in Google Services settings turn off 'use location', 'allow scanning', 'send usage and diagnostic data' options, and agree to terms of service;

   - **Display**: Set 'Brightness level' to about 75%; under advanced settings set 'Screen timeout' to 5 minutes, 'Font size' to largest, 'Display size' to largest, 'Screen saver' to never start

- **Home screen**: Remove all apps on screen, including those on the bottom bar;

- **Installing apps**:
   - **Play Store**: Login using Google Account, turning off 'Back up to Google Drive' when the option appears. Install 'Withings Health Mate', and 'MacroDroid'.
   - **Withings Health Mate**: Login; install Move ECG device (including allowing access to location, and setting daily step goal to 15,000, and selecting the 'Right' wrist); turn off persistent notifications under settings.

   - **MacroDroid**: Share the following macros from an already setup phone via Bluetooth: (i) Cancel macros; (ii) Close all apps; (iii) Launch healthmate; (iv) Launch pulseon software. Then use the 'Export/Import' function in MacroDroid to import each one in turn from the 'Bluetooth' folder, giving the necessary permissions. Finally, add the red, green and yellow MacroDroid widget buttons on the home screen.

- **Finishing setup**:
   - Sign out of Google account
