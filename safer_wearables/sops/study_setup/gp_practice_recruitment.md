## Identifying potential GP Practices

GP Practices must meet the following criteria to participate in the study:
1. Taken part in the SAFER Programme, with screening completed.
2. Part of a CRN region participating in the SAFER Wearables study.
3. Sufficient SAFER participants at the practice:
   - &#8805; 45 participants, including
   - &#8805; 6 AF participants

Potential GP Practices can be identified automatically using the `SAFER_data_analysis.m (or similar)` script.

## Recruiting GP Practices

The process for recruiting GP Practices consists of the following steps.

### Working with CRNs

Firstly, arrangements are put in place with the relevant CRN(s) where practices are to be recruited. The steps include:
- Sharing study documentation
- Providing a study summary to help with the recruitment of GP Practices.
- Specifying potential GP Practices
- Agreeing costings (including Service Support Costs and Research Costs Part B, which are paid by the CRN) for a specified number of sites.
- Developing a PIC agreement (which needs to be approved by the Sponsor and the NHS R&D department).

### Receiving EOIs

The CRN contacts GP Practices, and then Expressions of Interest (EOIs) are passed on by the CRN, and include contact details for the relevant Practices. 

### Responding to EOIs

An initial response email is sent to EOIs, including:
- A thank you
- The broader topic
- An outline of the whole study
- The role of the Practice within the study, including what is required of them
- Study documentation (protocol, PIS, consent form, invitation letter)
- PIC agreement
- HRA approvals
- Next steps: confirming point of contact, site initiation visit.

### Site initiation visit
- Remote, using presentation

### Approvals
- Complete paperwork: PIC agreement
- Get approval from sponsor
- Inform practice of approval

## Inviting participants

- Set up a docmail account for this GP Practice.
- Arrange a convenient time for a remote meeting to send invitation letters.
