# Manuscript Templates

Sometimes I've found it useful when writing an article to have a template as a starting point. It can save time when formatting the manuscript to make it presentable, and in some cases, can help ensure that a submitted manuscript complies with a journal's requirements (although these can change over time).

The following submitted manuscripts are publicly available:
- **Biomedical Signal Processing and Control:** The [submitted manuscript](https://zenodo.org/record/5211463/files/Impedance%20SQI%20manuscript%20-%20Oct%202020%20revision.docx?download=1) for the article titled '[An impedance pneumography signal quality index: Design, assessment and application to respiratory rate monitoring](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2020.102339)'.
- **AJP Heart and Circulatory Physiology:** The [submitted manuscript](https://zenodo.org/record/5211457/files/Modelling%20arterial%20pulse%20waves%20in%20healthy%20ageing%20%28submitted%20manuscript%29.docx?download=1) for the article titled '[Modeling arterial pulse waves in healthy aging: a database for in silico evaluation of hemodynamics and pulse wave indexes](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019)'.
- **International Electronic Conference on Sensors and Applications:** Whilst the [conference](https://ecsa-8.sciforum.net/) does provide article templates (which are probably a better starting point), the [submitted manuscript](https://zenodo.org/record/5211472/files/PCharlton%20et%20al%20-%20Acquiring%20wearable%20PPG%20data%20%28submitted%20manuscript%29.docx?download=1) for the article titled '[Acquiring wearable photoplethysmography data in daily life: The PPG Diary Pilot Study](https://doi.org/10.3390/ecsa-7-08233)'.
