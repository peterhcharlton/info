# Journals

I have found the following journals to be highly relevant in my research into physiological measurement techniques, and in the broader field of biomedical engineering:

* [Physiological Measurement](http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334/): including several [Focus Issues](http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334/page/Focus%20issues), including one on the [PPG](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334/page/Photoplethysmography-Methods-and-Applications).
