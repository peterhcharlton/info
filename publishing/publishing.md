This page provides a few resources related to publishing and disseminating research:

## Journals

I have found the following journals to be highly relevant in my research into physiological measurement techniques, and in the broader field of biomedical engineering:

* [Physiological Measurement](http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334/): including several [Focus Issues](http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334/page/Focus%20issues), including one on the [PPG](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334/page/Photoplethysmography-Methods-and-Applications).
* [IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10)
* [Annals of Biomedical Engineering](http://www.springer.com/biomed/journal/10439)
* [Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6221020)
* [Medical Engineering & Physics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/medical-engineering-and-physics)
* [Biomedical Engineering Online](https://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/)
* [Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/ijmt20)
* [Biomedical Signal Processing and Control](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/biomedical-signal-processing-and-control/)
* [Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing](http://www.springer.com/medicine/anesthesiology/journal/10877)
* [Medical & Biological Engineering and Computing](https://link.springer.com/journal/11517)
* [IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4664312/)
* [IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8782705)
* [MDPI Sensors](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors): see also the upcoming Special Issues on on [Smart Sensing for Advanced Sleep Analysis](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/sens_sleep), [Sensing for Health Monitoring](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/WSPUSHM), [Medical Applications of Sensor Systems and Devices](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/MASSD), [Biomedical Signal Processing for Disease Diagnosis](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/BSPDD) and [Biomedical Signal Processing](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/BiomedicalSignalProcessing).
* [JRSM Cardiovascular Disease](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/cvd): see also the upcoming [Special Issue](https://journals.sagepub.com/page/cvd/call-for-papers/waveform-analysis) on Advances in Waveform Analysis for Understanding Cardiovascular Function.
* [MDPI Information](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information): see also the upcoming [Special Issue](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information/special_issues/Smart_Health_Monitoring) on Ubiquitous Sensing for Smart Health Monitoring.

In addition, [this webinar](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/8013/301799/an-introduction-to-best-practices-for-refereeing-a-journal-manuscript) provides a useful "introduction to best practices for refereeing a journal manuscript", including a referee report template. [This webpage](http://www.drpaulwong.com/how-to-write-a-good-manuscript-review/) and [this webpage](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/13445048/data/v6) give top tips on writing a good review.

A cover letter template is available [here](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/writing-a-cover-letter/).

## Conferences

* [International Electronic Conference on Sensors and Applications](https://ecsa-6.sciforum.net/): an online conference which accepts both poster and 6-page paper submissions, and has open-access proceedings.
* [Innovations and Applications of Monitoring Perfusion, Oxygenation and Ventilation Intl Symposium](https://iampov.org/): a symposium being held in London with a strong emphasis on the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal.

## Data Repositories

I have used these data repositories to make resources publicly available:

* [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): Zenodo accepts many types of resources (such as datasets, images, posters, presentations, software ...). See [this page](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=%22peter%20h%20charlton%22) for examples of resources I have uploaded.
* [PhysioNet](https://www.physionet.org/): PhysioNet is a subject-specific repository for physiological signals.
* [King's Research Data Management System](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/library/researchsupport/research-data-management/Preserve-and-Share/Deposit-your-data-with-Kings3.aspx): A repository available to members of King's College London.
