# Repositories

I have used these data repositories to make resources publicly available:

* [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): Zenodo accepts many types of resources (such as datasets, images, posters, presentations, software ...). See [this page](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=%22peter%20h%20charlton%22) for examples of resources I have uploaded.
* [PhysioNet](https://www.physionet.org/): PhysioNet is a subject-specific repository for physiological signals.
* [King's Research Data Management System](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/library/researchsupport/research-data-management/Preserve-and-Share/Deposit-your-data-with-Kings3.aspx): A repository available to members of King's College London.
