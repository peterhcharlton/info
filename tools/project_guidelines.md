# Project Guidelines
{: .no_toc }

The following guidelines are designed for 6-week research projects.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Overview

I tend to have three aims when supervising students on research projects:
1. To provide students with experience at each stage of a research project.
2. To equip students with essential skills for conducting scientific research.
3. To provide opportunity to perform novel research which could impact healthcare.

Typically, students are asked to complete the following tasks:

| Week | Tasks |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pre-project | [Pre-reading](#pre-reading) |
| 1 | [Learning objectives](#learning-objectives) <br> [Literature review](#literature-review) <br> [Research Plan](#research-plan) <br> [Data Access](#data-access) |
| 2 | [Literature review](#literature-review) <br> [Research Plan](#research-plan) <br> [Data Access](#data-access) |
| 3 | [Experiments](#experiments) <br> [Project Report](#project-report) |
| 4 | [Experiments](#experiments) <br> [Project Report](#project-report) |
| 5 | [Experiments](#experiments) <br> [Project Report](#project-report) |
| 6 | [Project Report](#project-report) <br> [Project Presentation](#project-presentation) |
| Post-project | [Conference Submission](#conference-submission) |

In my experience, 6 weeks is an appropriate amount of time in which students can gain experience at each stage of a research project, develop new skills, and make valuable contributions to our ongoing research studies.

## Pre-reading
_Pre-project_

You may want to start work on the project early, in which case I would recommend reading some key articles in the field. These could be on topics such as:
- The clinical background to the project.
- Current approaches being used to tackle the problem.
- Previous research conducted by our group which relates to the project.

I will be happy to recommend some suitable articles.

## Learning objectives
_Week 1_

It is good to firstly think about what you would like to learn from the project. You may find it helpful to list some learning objectives, which could include:
- Gaining experience across each of the different stages of a research project
- Developing particular research skills (_e.g._ writing a literature review, using statistical analysis techniques, writing code)
- Preparing an abstract suitable for conference submission
- Understanding good practice for clinical research (such as by undertaking a [Good Clinical Practice](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/health-and-care-professionals/learning-and-support/good-clinical-practice.htm) course)

We will discuss your hopes for the project during the first week. This process will help me tailor the project towards your personal learning objectives.

## Literature Review
_Weeks 1-2_

A literature review is a key step in performing valuable scientific research. It allows you to: (i) understand the problem being tackled; (ii) appreciate current approaches to tackle the problem; and (iii) identify potential areas for further research to move the field forward. Your literature review will provide a basis with which to define the aim(s) of your project, and potentially provide insight into how you could design your experiments to address these aims (perhaps building on the methodology used in previous studies). Therefore, it is important to get started on a literature review early in the project, preferably performing most of the work in Week 1.

I would suggest the following steps to create a literature review:
1. **Explore your project:** Discuss the project with me, and have a quick look into key topics underpinning the project, in order to understand it more fully. Explore our current understanding of the three items listed above: (i) the problem being tackled; (ii) current approaches to tackle the problem; and (iii) potential areas for further research.
2. **Search for relevant publications:** Use [search engines](search_engines) to identify key publications relating to the project, bearing in mind the three items above. You will probably find too many publications to read in a year, let alone a 6-week project, so be selective. Often a review article can help to understand the broader context in which the literature sits - feel free to ask me if I would recommend any particular review articles.
3. **Extract information from the publications:** Having identified key publications, read them and make notes on any relevant points in the publications. Relevant points could include: (i) the clinical significance of the problem being tackled; (ii) the aims and findings of previous research in the field; (iii) the methodology used in previous studies; and (iv) suggested directions for future research (which could either be stated explicitly, or which you may identify by recognising gaps in the research conducted).
4. **Sort the information:** Categorise and sort the information into themes - ideally you should expect to write one paragraph on each theme. Remove any information which you think isn't too relevant.
5. **Structure your writing:** You are now in a position to structure your literature review. I would suggest an Introduction and a Conclusion, and between these, a paragraph on each theme. The paragraphs on each theme could follow this format:
   - **Point:** A single sentence summarising the point you will make (_e.g._ Most of the literature on screening for atrial fibrillation has used 12-lead ECG recordings.)
   - **Quotations:** Several sentences in which you refer to the evidence supporting this point - perhaps one or two sentences per publication (_e.g._ Doliwa _et al._ assessed the performance of a single-lead ECG device against reference diagnoses from 12-lead recordings [[ref](https://doi.org/10.1080/14017430802593435)].).
   - **Comment:** A single-sentence providing your (critical) view on the significance of this point. (_e.g._ 12-lead ECGs are often viewed as a gold standard reference against which to compare single-lead ECGs, as demonstrated by the inclusion of such studies in [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg35/resources/leadi-ecg-devices-for-detecting-symptomatic-atrial-fibrillation-using-single-time-point-testing-in-primary-care-pdf-1053752401861) relating to Lead-I ECG devices.)
6. **Write your review:** Perhaps start by writing the paragraph on each theme, and then write the Introduction and Conclusion last.
7. **Provide references:** Use a reference manager to provide inline citations, and a list of references (feel free to ask me for recommendations).
8. **Proof-read your review:** Ideally, don't look at the review for a couple of days after writing the first draft, and then re-read it to identify any areas for improvement.

**Further thoughts:** Ideally, a literature review should critically appraise the literature, rather than simply stating what has been said in the literature. Usually, a review of between 1,000 and 3,000 words is appropriate. You may wish to add to your literature review during the project if you find additional relevant publications.

## Research Plan
_Weeks 1-2_

The next key step in conducting scientific research is to make a research plan. This will summarise the motivation for your project, its aim(s), the methods you intend to use in your experiments, and the expected outcomes of the project. A well-written research plan can make it much more straightforward to conduct experiments and write them up.

I would suggest trying to summarise the following on a single side of A4:
- **The clinical background to the project**: 1- 2 sentences
- **The problem being tackled**: 1- 2 sentences
- **Current approaches to tackling this problem**: 1- 2 sentences
- **The aim(s) of this project**: 1- 2 sentences, indicating how your project will help tackle the problem. You could have an overall aim, and then a few (perhaps 3) objectives, where each objective refers to a research question which you intend to answer.
- **The methods to be used in this project:** 4-5 sentences providing key details of the methods you intend to use, such as the dataset and a brief overview of the analyses you will conduct. You may find it helpful to split the methods into parts (_e.g._ one part per research question).
- **The expected outcomes**: 1- 2 sentences on how this project will help tackle the problem.

The research plan does not need to be detailed - for instance, you probably won't know at this stage how many participants are in the dataset, or which statistical tests you might perform. Rather, it should provide a high-level summary of the project.

## Data Access
_Weeks 1-2_

It is likely that you will use one or more datasets in your project. These could be publicly available datasets, or private datasets hosted within an institution:

- **Publicly available datasets**: If you are using a publicly available dataset (such as those listed [here](datasets)), then hopefully it should be relatively straightforward to access the data. I have provided some MATLAB code to help collate some of these datasets into suitable formats for analysis [here](datasets).
- **Private datasets**: If you are using a private dataset (such as the SAFER dataset) then you may need remote access to the data. Discuss this with me, and if you do require remote access to a dataset hosted in Cambridge, then it is likely you will need to follow the instructions provided by the Clinical School Computing Service ([here](https://confluence.medschl.cam.ac.uk/display/FAQ)) in order to gain remote access. Specifically, you will need:
   - **A suitable login**: if you are using a temporary account then you will need to reset its password [here](https://sspp.medschl.cam.ac.uk/).
   - **A VPN connection**: You will need to connect to a VPN in order to have permission to access the system. See the instructions [here](https://confluence.medschl.cam.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=12094187) on setting up a VPN. Note that you will be using the [settings for the Biomedical Campus](https://confluence.medschl.cam.ac.uk/display/FAQ/New+VPN+Client+settings+for+Biomedical+Campus). If you have been given a temporary login then you will use that to login to the VPN.
   - **Remote desktop software**: If you are using a Windows computer at home, then see [these instructions](https://confluence.medschl.cam.ac.uk/display/FAQ/Remotely+Connect+to+Your+Work+PC#RemotelyConnecttoYourWorkPC-UsingRemoteDesktopConnectionfromhome) on how to remotely connect to the Cambridge computer from your home computer. Ask me for the name of the Cambridge computer that you are connecting to, and if you have been given a temporary login then use that to login. If you are using a Mac at home, then you will need to use a different piece of Remote desktop connection software - 'Microsoft Remote Desktop', which is free in the App Store.

## Experiments
_Weeks 3-5_

It will take time to understand the dataset(s) you are using. This is an important part of the project, and investing time at this stage will make conducting the experiments much easier.
