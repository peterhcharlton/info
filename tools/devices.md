## Photoplethysmogram (PPG) Acquisition Devices

The following wearable devices are suitable for acquiring PPG signals:

| Device     | Location | Signals | Data capture | Further details | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Smartcare Pulse Oximeter](http://devices.smartcareanalytics.co.uk/) | wrist with finger probe | dual-wavelength PPG | via Bluetooth | Designed to acquire raw red and infrared PPG signals (at 100 Hz). Requires real-time connection to an android device to capture data (a phone or tablet). We assessed the feasibility of using this device to acquire PPG data in daily life [here](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/publication/ppg_diary/). |
| [Empatica E4](https://www.empatica.com/en-gb/research/e4/) | wriststrap | PPG, EDA, accel, temp  | On-device storage or via Bluetooth | Large on-device storage (up to 60 hours). PPG sampled at [64 Hz](https://support.empatica.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029719792-E4-data-BVP-expected-signal). |
| [PulseOn OHR Tracker](https://pulseon.com/tech/ohr-tracker) | wristband | PPG, accel  | On-device storage or via Bluetooth | Good on-device storage (around 14 hours in my testing). PPG sampled at 25 Hz. Commercialised by Maxim Integrated in their [Max-Health-Band](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/interface/sensor-interface/MAX-HEALTHBAND.html) |
