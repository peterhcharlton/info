## Licences

I find [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) a useful resource for identifying suitable licences.

This page provides a few licences which I have found helpful during my research:

### Software Licences

* **MIT License**: "The [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) is short and to the point. It lets people do almost anything they want with your project, like making and distributing closed source versions." _Source: [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) (text reproduced under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), hyperlink added)._
  - [This script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterhcharlton/info/master/creating_images/create_clinical_vs_lab_ppg_pulse_wave_plot.m) provides an example of using the MIT License in a MATLAB script.

* **GNU General Public License**: "The [GNU General Public License](https://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license) lets people do almost anything they want with your project, _except_ distributing closed source versions." _Source: [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) (text reproduced under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), hyperlink added)._

[This webpage](https://opensource.org/faq#apply-license) provides some useful information on how to apply a licence to a piece of software.

### Publication Licences
