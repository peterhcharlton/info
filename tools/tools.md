This page provides a few resources which I have found helpful in my research:

## Software Packages

I have found the following software packages particularly helpful during my research:

* **Reference Manager**: [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) is a free program which keeps your articles in one place. It allows you to search through the articles, and also create reference lists quickly which can be used in MS Word and Latex documents.
* **Latex Editor**: [TeXShop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeXShop) and [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) are free programs for editing latex documents. TeXShop is designed for MacOS, and TeXstudio is useful for other operating systems. TeXstudio requires a Latex typesetting system to function, such as [MikTex](https://miktex.org/). I have also found [TeXcount](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/texcount) useful for counting the number of words in Latex files (such as theses), including this [online version](https://app.uio.no/ifi/texcount/online.php). In addition, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an online latex editor.
* **Automated Backups**: [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) both allow you to backup your files to the cloud (automatically backing up any new or edited files when you're connected to the internet), and synchronise them between computers.
* **Code Respositories**: [GitHub](https://github.com/) allows you to backup your code online, keep a history of changes, and synchronise it between computers. It also provides a platform for creating a free website.
* **Matlab &reg; and Octave**: [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is widely used to perform mathematical analyses in university engineering departments. It requires a licence. [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is freely available software which is largely compatible with Matlab &reg;.

## Search Engines for Finding Publications

I have used the following search engines to find publications:

* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/): Provides both a simple and an 'Advanced Search'.
* [IEEE Xplore <sup>TM</sup>](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/): A database of scientific and technical content published by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and partners.
* [ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/): A database of scientific, technical and medical research
* [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/): A database of peer-reviewed research literature
* [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/): A database of medical research, including much biomedical engineering research
