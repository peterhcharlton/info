## Software Packages

I have found the following software packages particularly helpful during my research:

* **Reference Manager**: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free program which keeps your articles in one place. It allows you to search through the articles, and also create reference lists quickly which can be used in MS Word and Latex documents.
* **Latex Editor**: Perhaps the easiest place to start using Latex is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online latex editor. It is very helpful for writing articles collaboratively, but only functions through a web browser. If you want a local installation for offline work then I have used [TeXShop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeXShop) and [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/): these are free programs for editing latex documents. TeXShop is designed for MacOS, and TeXstudio is useful for other operating systems. TeXstudio requires a Latex typesetting system to function, such as [MikTex](https://miktex.org/). I have also found [TeXcount](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/texcount) useful for counting the number of words in Latex files (such as theses), including this [online version](https://app.uio.no/ifi/texcount/online.php).
* **Automated Backups**: There are several cloud storage solutions such as [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), and [OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage). These allow you to backup your files to the cloud (automatically backing up any new or edited files when you're connected to the internet), and synchronise them between computers. If you work at a university then often the university will provide a subscription to a cloud service, providing more storage space than is typically available through a free account.
* **Code Respositories**: [GitHub](https://github.com/) allows you to backup your code online, keep a history of changes, and synchronise it between computers. It also provides a platform for creating a free website.
* **Matlab &reg; and Octave**: [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is widely used to perform mathematical analyses in university engineering departments. It requires a licence. [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is freely available software which is largely compatible with Matlab &reg;.
