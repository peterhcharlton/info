## Search Engines

I have used the following search engines to find publications:

* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/): Provides both a simple and an 'Advanced Search'.
* [IEEE Xplore <sup>TM</sup>](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/): A database of scientific and technical content published by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and partners.
* [ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/): A database of scientific, technical and medical research
* [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/): A database of peer-reviewed research literature
* [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/): A database of medical research, including much biomedical engineering research
