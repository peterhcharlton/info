## Recording ECGs

Participants of the SAFER programme are asked to use a handheld ECG device to record 30-second, single-lead ECGs at home. They record approximately 4 ECGs per day for approximately 3 weeks, providing around 84 ECGs per participant.

_The handheld ECG device_

The device being used is the [Zenicor-EKG](https://zenicor.com/zenicor-ekg/) device (see [here](https://zenicor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/MG_1945_low-300x200.jpg) for a picture of the device). This device was previously used in the STROKESTOP studies.

## Labelling ECGs

### Automated analysis of ECGs

ECGs are analysed using [Cardiolund's ECG analysis algorithm](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/info/tools/reading/af_screening.html#cardiolunds-ecg-parser-algorithm). This algorithm applies binary classifications (known as tags) to each ECG signal, which are descirbed [here](https://cardiolund.com/ecg-parser/).

Selected tags are used to identify ECGs which exhibit signs of possible AF, and therefore warrant manual review. The use of algorithm tags is detailed [here](https://universityofcambridgecloud-my.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/personal/pc657_cam_ac_uk/Documents/SAFER_Engineering_Resources/SAFER_study_methods/Use%20of%20algorithm%20tags.md?csf=1&web=1&e=tsnrFN).

### Participant-level diagnoses

Participants who have at least one ECG exhibiting signs of possible AF are sent for manual review by one or more reviewers (details of this process are provided [here](https://universityofcambridgecloud-my.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/personal/pc657_cam_ac_uk/Documents/SAFER_Engineering_Resources/SAFER_study_methods/Clinical%20review.md?csf=1&web=1&e=qCcgKp), and details of the tags used to identify signs of possible AF are provided [here](https://universityofcambridgecloud-my.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/personal/pc657_cam_ac_uk/Documents/SAFER_Engineering_Resources/SAFER_study_methods/Use%20of%20algorithm%20tags.md?csf=1&web=1&e=NcchiT)).

Each participant is assigned a participant-level diagnosis.

### ECG-level labels

During the process of reviewing participants, cardiologists may label individual ECGs on an ad-hoc basis. Labels include: AF, non-AF, and poor quality.

### Reviewing ECGs

Details of how ECGs were reviewed in the SAFER Programme to allocate diagnoses are provided [here](https://universityofcambridgecloud-my.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/personal/pc657_cam_ac_uk/Documents/SAFER_Engineering_Resources/SAFER_study_methods/Clinical%20review.md?csf=1&web=1&e=mcAfBi).
