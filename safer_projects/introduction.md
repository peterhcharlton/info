## The SAFER Programme

The [SAFER Programme](https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/) is investigating whether using ECG devices to screen for atrial fibrillation (AF) is effective and cost-effective in reducing the incidence of stroke. It is being conducted by researchers in the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. Many thousands of participants have taken part in the research programme.

### SAFER Phases

The Programme consists of three phases:

- The Feasibility study: (_a.k.a Feas1_) A study in 10 GP Practices, including a face-to-face appointment, which 2,141 participants took part in. This has finished, confirming that it is feasible to deliver an AF screening programme in general practice, and that high numbers of patients accept an offer of AF screening and go on to complete the screening process.
- The Remote Feasibility study: (_a.k.a Feas2_) When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, it became clear that screening could not be delivered in the practice. An additional feasibility study was conducted with participants from 3 GP Practices, in which the screening was delivered remotely.
- Trial, including an internal pilot study: Expected to enrol many 10,000s of participants from 100s of GP Practices, a third of whom will be offered screening. They will be followed up for an average of 5 years.

### The Screening Process

The three main steps of the screening process which I?ll refer to are:

- **ECGs recorded at home:** Firstly, participants are sent a handheld device which takes 30-second ECG recordings between two thumbs. Participants are asked to record an ECG 4 times per day, for 3 weeks, producing approximately 84 ECGs per participant.
- **Automated analysis:** Secondly, the ECG recordings are automatically analysed to identify any that may contain AF.
- **Clinical review:** Thirdly, those ECGs which may contain AF are sent for clinical review to make a final diagnosis. Any participants diagnosed with AF then discuss possible anticoagulation with their GP.

## Previous work

An overview of the work I have been involved in so far is provided [here](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/project/safer-wearables/), including publications arising from previous student projects (under the 'Publications' heading lower on the page). A more comprehensive list of publications arising from SAFER is provided [here](https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/trial-news/outputs/publications/).

## Project Guidelines

I tend to use [these guidelines](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/project_guidelines/schedule.html) when supervising projects (particularly when supervising [SSC projects](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/project_guidelines/sscs.html)).
