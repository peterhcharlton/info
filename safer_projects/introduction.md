## The SAFER Programme

The [SAFER Programme](https://www.safer.phpc.cam.ac.uk/) is nvestigating whether using ECG devices to screen for atrial fibrillation (AF) is effective and cost-effective in reducing the incidence of stroke. It is being conducted by researchers in the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge. Many thousands of participants have taken part in the research programme.

The Programme consists of three phases:
- The Feasibility Study
- The Remote Feasibility Study
- The Trial
