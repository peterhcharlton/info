This page provides a few resources which I have found helpful in my research:


## Writing Grant Applications

I have benefited from the resources provided by [Parker Derrington Ltd](http://parkerderrington.com/), which are provided in their [blog](https://parkerderrington.com/catalogue/), including:
* [Preparing to write a grant application](http://parkerderrington.com/are-you-ready-to-start/)
* [Structuring the application around 10 key sentences](http://parkerderrington.com/get-the-framework-in-place-quickly/)
* [Writing 10 key sentences](http://parkerderrington.com/key-sentence-skeletons/)

I also found [this webpage](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/funding-interview) helpful for interview preparation, and [this webpage](http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/45246.html) helpful for understanding what makes for a good letter of support.


## Careers Resources

* Time management: [This website](https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/) is helpful for PhD students.

## Ethics Resources

* [HRA Decision Tool](http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/ethics/): This is helpful for determining whether your intended project requires ethical approval.

* [Publishing Ethics](https://authorservices.wiley.com/asset/Best-Practice-Guidelines-on-Publishing-Ethics-2ed.pdf): Information on the ethics surrounding publications, with a helpful link to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' [recommendations](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) for identifying authors. The IEEE also provide a helpful [definition of authorship](http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/publish-with-ieee/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship/).
