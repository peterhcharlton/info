* [UK Policy for Health and Social Care Research](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/policies-standards-legislation/uk-policy-framework-health-social-care-research/): Principles for conducting health research.
* [Publishing Ethics](https://authorservices.wiley.com/asset/Best-Practice-Guidelines-on-Publishing-Ethics-2ed.pdf): Information on the ethics surrounding publications, with a helpful link to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' [recommendations](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) for identifying authors. The IEEE also provide a helpful [definition of authorship](http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/publish-with-ieee/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship/).
