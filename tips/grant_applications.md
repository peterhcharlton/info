# Grant Applications

I have benefited from the resources provided by [Parker Derrington Ltd](http://parkerderrington.com/), which are provided in their [blog](https://parkerderrington.com/catalogue/), including:
* [Preparing to write a grant application](http://parkerderrington.com/are-you-ready-to-start/)
* [Structuring the application around 10 key sentences](http://parkerderrington.com/get-the-framework-in-place-quickly/)
* [Writing 10 key sentences](http://parkerderrington.com/key-sentence-skeletons/)

I also found [this webpage](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/funding-interview) helpful for interview preparation, and [this webpage](http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/45246.html) helpful for understanding what makes for a good letter of support.
