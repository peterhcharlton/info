# Teaching Resources

This page provides links to resources which I have used in teaching.

## Software Packages

I have found the following software packages particularly helpful during my research:

* **Reference Manager**: [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) is a free program which keeps your articles in one place. It allows you to search through the articles, and also create reference lists quickly.
* **Latex Editor**: [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) is a free program for editing latex documents.
* **Automated Backups**: [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) both allow you to backup your files to the cloud (automatically backing up any new or edited files when you're connected to the internet), and synchronise them between computers.
* **Code Respositories**: [GitHub](https://github.com/) allows you to backup your code online, keep a history of changes, and synchronise it between computers. It also provides a platform for creating a free website.

## Search Engines for Publications

The following search engines have been useful for finding publications:

* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/)
* [IEEE Xplore <sup>TM</sup>](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/): A database of scientific and technical content published by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and partners.
* [ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/): A database of scientific, technical and medical research
* [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/): A database of peer-reviewed research literature
* [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/): A database of medical research, including much biomedical engineering research
