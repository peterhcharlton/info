# Teaching Resources

This page provides links to resources which I have used in teaching.

## Software Packages

I have found the following software packages particularly helpful during my research:

* **Reference Manager**: [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) is a free program which keeps your articles in one place. It allows you to search through the articles, and also create reference lists quickly.
* **Latex Editor**: [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) is a free program for editing latex documents. It requires a Latex typesetting system to function, such as [MikTex](https://miktex.org/). I have also found [TeXcount](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/texcount) useful for counting the number of words in Latex files (such as theses).
* **Automated Backups**: [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) and [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) both allow you to backup your files to the cloud (automatically backing up any new or edited files when you're connected to the internet), and synchronise them between computers.
* **Code Respositories**: [GitHub](https://github.com/) allows you to backup your code online, keep a history of changes, and synchronise it between computers. It also provides a platform for creating a free website.

## Search Engines for Finding Publications

The following search engines have been useful for finding publications:

* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/)
* [IEEE Xplore <sup>TM</sup>](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/): A database of scientific and technical content published by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and partners.
* [ScienceDirect](http://www.sciencedirect.com/): A database of scientific, technical and medical research
* [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/): A database of peer-reviewed research literature
* [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/): A database of medical research, including much biomedical engineering research

## Relevant Journals

I have found the following journals to be highly relevant in my research into physiological measurement techniques, and in the broader field of biomedical engineering:

* [Physiological Measurement](http://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0967-3334/)
* [IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10/)
* [Annals of Biomedical Engineering](http://www.springer.com/biomed/journal/10439)
* [Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6221020)
* [Medical Engineering & Physics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/medical-engineering-and-physics)
* [Biomedical Engineering Online](https://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/)
* [Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/ijmt20)
* [Biomedical Signal Processing and Control](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/biomedical-signal-processing-and-control/)
* [Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing](http://www.springer.com/medicine/anesthesiology/journal/10877)
* [Medical & Biological Engineering and Computing](https://link.springer.com/journal/11517)

## Algorithms

Here are some of the publicly available algorithms which I have found helpful, and which I would recommend. They are written for Matlab &reg; .

### Beat detectors

* [ECG beat detector](http://www.mit.edu/~gari/CODE/ECGtools/ecgBag/rpeakdetect.m): A beat detector for use with the ECG, written by Gari Clifford. Based on the algorithm described by Pan, Hamilton and Tompkins (refs: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1985.325532) and [2](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325695)). Available under the GNU GPL.
* [Arterial blood pressure beat detector](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/cardiac-output/code/2analyze/wabp.m): A beat detector for use with the ABP signal, written by James Sun. Based on the code and algorithm developed by Wei Zong (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2003.1291140) ).

### Physiological Parameter Estimation

* [Cardiac Output Estimation](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/cardiac-output/): Scripts to estimate cardiac output from the ABP signal, written by James Sun.
* [Pulse Transit Time Estimation](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37746-ttalgorithm): Scripts to estimate pulse transit time using simultaneous pulsatile waveforms, written by Nick Gaddum.


## Data Repositories

I have used these data repositories to make resources publicly available:

* [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): Zenodo accepts many types of resources (such as datasets, images, posters, presentations, software ...).
* [King's Research Data Management System](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/library/researchsupport/research-data-management/Preserve-and-Share/Deposit-your-data-with-Kings3.aspx): A repository available to members of King's College London.

## Matlab &reg; Scripts

I have found the following Matlab &reg; scripts very helpful:

* [export_fig](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig): Useful for saving Matlab &reg; figures in formats for publication. For instance, often publications require figures in *.eps* format with fonts embedded, which this script can provide.

## Textbooks

* [The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](http://www.dspguide.com/)
* [Advanced Methods and Tools for ECG Data Analysis](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gari/ecgbook.html)
* [Statistics Notes in the BMJ](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/pubs/pbstnote.htm): Although not strictly a textbook, this series of notes provides a very helpful introduction to several statistical topics frequently encountered in medical research, written by Bland, Altman et al.

## Datasets

* [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/): An invaluable collection of physiological datasets, many of which contain physiological signals such as the ECG.
