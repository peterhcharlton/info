# Peter H Charlton's Resources

This page provides links to resources which I have used in teaching.

## Matlab &reg; Scripts

I have found the following Matlab &reg; scripts very helpful:

* [export_fig](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig): Useful for saving Matlab &reg; figures in formats for publication. For instance, often publications require figures in *.eps* format with fonts embedded, which this script can provide.

[This publication](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) provides some helpful tips on writing code.

## Datasets

* [Arterial Pulse Wave Database](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb): Simulated arterial pulse waves at a range of common measurement sites for 4,374 virtual subjects aged 25-75 years, representative of healthy adults (ref [1](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019)).

Simulated using the Nektar1D model of pulse wave propagation (ref: [3](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordi_Alastruey/publication/256009078_Arterial_pulse_wave_haemodynamics/links/00b7d52164d5dd7b3c000000/Arterial-pulse-wave-haemodynamics.pdf) ).
* [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/): An invaluable collection of physiological datasets, many of which contain physiological signals such as the ECG.
* [CapnoBase](http://www.capnobase.org/database/pulse-oximeter-ieee-tbme-benchmark/): Recordings of ECG, PPG and capnography signals from patients during elective surgery and routine anaesthesia. Contains annotations of breaths. (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2246160) ).

## Writing Grant Applications

I have benefited from the resources provided by [Parker Derrington Ltd](http://parkerderrington.com/), which are provided in their [blog](https://parkerderrington.com/catalogue/), including:
* [Preparing to write a grant application](http://parkerderrington.com/are-you-ready-to-start/)
* [Structuring the application around 10 key sentences](http://parkerderrington.com/get-the-framework-in-place-quickly/)
* [Writing 10 key sentences](http://parkerderrington.com/key-sentence-skeletons/)

I also found [this webpage](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/funding-interview) helpful for interview preparation, and [this webpage](http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/45246.html) helpful for understanding what makes for a good letter of support.

## Ethics Resources

* [UK Policy for Health and Social Care Research](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/policies-standards-legislation/uk-policy-framework-health-social-care-research/): Principles for conducting health research.
* [Publishing Ethics](https://authorservices.wiley.com/asset/Best-Practice-Guidelines-on-Publishing-Ethics-2ed.pdf): Information on the ethics surrounding publications, with a helpful link to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' [recommendations](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) for identifying authors. The IEEE also provide a helpful [definition of authorship](http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/publish-with-ieee/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship/).

## Careers Resources
