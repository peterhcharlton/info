# Algorithms

This page provides details of publicly available algorithms that I have found useful in my research.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Here are some of the publicly available algorithms which I have found helpful, and which I would recommend. They are written for Matlab &reg; .

### Physiological Parameter Estimation

* [Cardiac Output Estimation](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/cardiac-output/): Scripts to estimate cardiac output from the ABP signal, written by James Sun.
* [Pulse Transit Time Estimation](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37746-ttalgorithm): Scripts to estimate pulse transit time using simultaneous pulsatile waveforms, written by Nick Gaddum.
* [Respiratory Rate Estimation](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/algorithms.html): Code for assessing the performance of respiratory rate algorithms applied to the ECG and PPG, written by Peter H Charlton.

### Pulse Wave Analysis

* [PulseAnalyse](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pulse-analyse): a tool for analysing arterial pulse waves, such as blood pressure and photoplethysmogram pulse waves, written by Peter H Charlton.
* [kreservoir](http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/k.parker/wave_intensity_web/kreservoir_v10.m): an algorithm used to separate arterial pressure into reservoir and excess pressures, written by [Prof Kim Parker](http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/k.parker/).

### ECG Analysis

* [ECG Processing Algorithms](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gari/CODE/ECGtools/): a collection of ECG processing algorithms written by Gari Clifford.
* [ECG-kit](https://marianux.github.io/ecg-kit/): a Matlab toolbox for cardiovascular signal processing (ref [1](http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.86) ).
