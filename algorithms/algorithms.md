Here are some of the publicly available algorithms which I have found helpful, and which I would recommend. They are written for Matlab &reg; .

### Beat Detectors

* [ECG beat detector](http://www.mit.edu/~gari/CODE/ECGtools/ecgBag/rpeakdetect.m): A beat detector for use with the ECG, written by Gari Clifford. Based on the algorithm described by Pan, Hamilton and Tompkins (refs: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1985.325532) and [2](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325695)). Available under the GNU GPL.
* [Arterial blood pressure beat detector](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/cardiac-output/code/2analyze/wabp.m): A beat detector for use with the ABP signal, written by James Sun. Based on the code and algorithm developed by Wei Zong (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2003.1291140) ).
* [PPG beat detector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/master/RRest_v3.0/Algorithms/extract_resp_sig/feat_based_extraction/IMS_peak_detector/adaptPulseSegment.m): A beat detector for use with the PPG signal, written by Marco Pimentel. Based on the algorithm described in Karlen et al (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346628) ).

### Signal Quality Assessment

* [Signal Quality Indices for ECG and PPG](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/algorithms.html): Signal quality indices for use with the ECG and PPG signals (ref: [1](https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2014.2338351) ). They are contained within the *RRest* algorithms.
* [Signal Quality Index for ABP](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/cardiac-output/code/2analyze/jSQI.m): written by James Sun.

### Physiological Parameter Estimation

* [Cardiac Output Estimation](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/cardiac-output/): Scripts to estimate cardiac output from the ABP signal, written by James Sun.
* [Pulse Transit Time Estimation](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37746-ttalgorithm): Scripts to estimate pulse transit time using simultaneous pulsatile waveforms, written by Nick Gaddum.
* [Respiratory Rate Estimation](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/algorithms.html): Code for assessing the performance of respiratory rate algorithms applied to the ECG and PPG, written by Peter H Charlton.

### Pulse Wave Analysis

* [PulseAnalyse](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pulse-analyse): a tool for analysing arterial pulse waves, such as blood pressure and photoplethysmogram pulse waves, written by Peter H Charlton.
* [kreservoir](http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/k.parker/wave_intensity_web/kreservoir_v10.m): an algorithm used to separate arterial pressure into reservoir and excess pressures, written by [Prof Kim Parker](http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/k.parker/).

### ECG Analysis

* [ECG Processing Algorithms](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gari/CODE/ECGtools/): a collection of ECG processing algorithms written by Gari Clifford.
* [ECG-kit](https://marianux.github.io/ecg-kit/): a Matlab toolbox for cardiovascular signal processing (ref [1](http://doi.org/10.5334/jors.86) ).
