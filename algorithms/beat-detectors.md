## Electrocardiogram (ECG) Beat Detectors

[ECG beat detector](http://www.mit.edu/~gari/CODE/ECGtools/ecgBag/rpeakdetect.m): A beat detector for use with the ECG, written by Gari Clifford. Based on the algorithm described by Pan, Hamilton and Tompkins (refs: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1985.325532) and [2](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.1986.325695)). Available under the GNU GPL.

## Arterial Blood Pressure Beat Detectors

[Arterial blood pressure beat detector](https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/cardiac-output/code/2analyze/wabp.m): A beat detector for use with the ABP signal, written by James Sun. Based on the code and algorithm developed by Wei Zong (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2003.1291140) ).

## Photoplethysmogram (PPG) Beat Detectors

[PPG beat detector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/master/RRest_v3.0/Algorithms/extract_resp_sig/feat_based_extraction/IMS_peak_detector/adaptPulseSegment.m): A beat detector for use with the PPG signal, written by Marco Pimentel. Based on the algorithm described in Karlen et al (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346628) ).
