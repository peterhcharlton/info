# Datasets

This page provides details of publicly available datasets that I have found useful in my research.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Summary of Datasets

| Dataset     | Signals | Overview of protocol | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [WESAD](datasets/wesad) | PPG, ECG, resp, accel, others | Recordings at baseline and during amusement, stress and meditation |
| [PPG-DaLiA](datasets/ppg-dalia) | PPG, ECG, resp, accel, EDA | Recordings during activities of daily living |
| [CapnoBase](datasets/capnobase) | PPG, ECG, resp | Signals from patients during elective surgery and routine anaesthesia. (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2246160) ). |
| [Vortal](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/vortal_dataset.html) | PPG, ECG, resp | signals acquired from young and elderly healthy subjects at rest (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1088/0967-3334/37/4/610) [2](http://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/aa670e) ). |
| [Arterial Pulse Wave Database](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb) | PPG, BP, blood flow, blood vel | Simulated arterial pulse waves at a range of common measurement sites for 4,374 virtual subjects aged 25-75 years, representative of healthy adults (ref [1](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019)) |
| [Virtual Database of Pulse Waves](http://haemod.uk/virtual-database) | BP, blood flow, blood vel | Pulse waves simulated at several arterial sites under a range of cardiovascular conditions (refs: [1](http://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00175.2015) and [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.11.001)). Simulated using the Nektar1D model of pulse wave propagation (ref: [3](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordi_Alastruey/publication/256009078_Arterial_pulse_wave_haemodynamics/links/00b7d52164d5dd7b3c000000/Arterial-pulse-wave-haemodynamics.pdf) ). |
