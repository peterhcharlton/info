# Peter H Charlton's Resources

This page provides links to resources which I have used in teaching.



## Lecture Courses and Presentations

* [Biomedical Signal and Image Processing](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/health-sciences-and-technology/hst-582j-biomedical-signal-and-image-processing-spring-2007/index.htm): Available from MIT OpenCourseWare, including lecture slides and lab practical resources.
* [Teaching Medical Physics](http://www.iop.org/education/teacher/resources/teaching-medical-physics/page_54690.html): A set of resources provided by the Institute of Physics covering some commonly used physiological measurement and imaging techniques.

## Datasets

* [Arterial Pulse Wave Database](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/pwdb): Simulated arterial pulse waves at a range of common measurement sites for 4,374 virtual subjects aged 25-75 years, representative of healthy adults (ref [1](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00218.2019)).
* [Virtual Database of Pulse Waves](http://haemod.uk/virtual-database): Pulse waves simulated at several arterial sites under a range of cardiovascular conditions (refs: [1](http://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00175.2015) and [2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.11.001)). Simulated using the Nektar1D model of pulse wave propagation (ref: [3](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordi_Alastruey/publication/256009078_Arterial_pulse_wave_haemodynamics/links/00b7d52164d5dd7b3c000000/Arterial-pulse-wave-haemodynamics.pdf) ).
* [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/): An invaluable collection of physiological datasets, many of which contain physiological signals such as the ECG.
* [CapnoBase](http://www.capnobase.org/database/pulse-oximeter-ieee-tbme-benchmark/): Recordings of ECG, PPG and capnography signals from patients during elective surgery and routine anaesthesia. Contains annotations of breaths. (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2246160) ).
* [Vortal](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/vortal_dataset.html): Recordings of ECG, PPG, impedance pneumography, and reference oral-nasal respiratory signals acquired from young and elderly healthy subjects at rest (ref: [1](http://doi.org/10.1088/0967-3334/37/4/610) [2](http://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/aa670e) ).

## Public Engagement Resouces

* [UK Research and Innovation Guides](https://www.ukri.org/public-engagement/research-council-partners-and-public-engagement-with-research/guides-policies-research-and-publications/): A collection of guides on public engagment, including one on the [benefits](https://www.ukri.org/files/legacy/scisoc/rcukbenefitsofpe-pdf/) of public engagement for researchers.
